Following the [Roguelike Tutorial Revised](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/8ql895/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/)

## My Notes

### I'm using

* Windows 10 Pro x64
* Visual Studio Code x64
* Python 3.9.2 (64-bit), installed via exe from python.org
* https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod
* GitHub

Essentially:

* open the project dir in VSCode
* add/modify files in VSCode
* F5 (or Ctrl-F5) to run
* use VSCode's Source Control panel to Commit locally
* and then VSCode's Status Bar to create new branches and sync to GitHub
* use the built-in Terminal as needed

## P.S.
